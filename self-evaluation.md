# Self-Evaluation

## Name(s): 

Out of 25 points. Use output.txt created using 
`./create-output.sh > output.txt 2>&1` for guidance.

Complete all questions with "Q:"

Q: Does the program compile and run to completion: Yes/No

- If the program does not compile or gives a segmentation error when run, 
the maximum possible grade is 50%. No need to continue with the rest of self-evaluation

Q: All public functions have been implemented: ENTER_NUMBER

- -2 for each functionality not implemented

For each command, state Full, Partial or None to indicate

Q: Do the tests sufficiently test the code: ENTER_NUMBER

- Check under *7. Tests have full code coverage* paying attention to *The lines below were never executed*

Q: Are all functions in .h and .cpp file documents (min -3): ENTER_NUMBER
